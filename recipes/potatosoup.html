            <li> 2 stalks celery, diced </li>
            <li> 1 onion, chopped </li>
            <li> 3 cloves garlic, minced </li>
            <li> 8 potatoes, peeled and cubed </li>
            <li> 4 cups chicken stock, or enough to cover potatoes </li>
            <li> 3 tablespoons butter </li>
            <li> ¼ cup all-purpose flour </li>
            <li> 1 cup heavy cream </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon dried tarragon </li>
            <li> 3 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro </li>
            <li> salt and pepper to taste </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a Dutch oven, cook the bacon over medium heat until done. Remove bacon from pan, and set aside. Drain off all but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease.
            </li>

            <li>Cook celery and onion in reserved bacon drippings until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes. Add cubed potatoes, and toss to coat. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Return bacon to the pan, and add enough chicken stock to just cover the potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender.
            </li>

            <li>In a separate pan, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in the heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro. Bring the cream mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Stir the cream mixture into the potato mixture. Puree about 1/2 the soup, and return to the pan. Adjust seasonings to taste.

        </ol>
